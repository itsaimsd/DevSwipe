# DevSwipe

ðŸ“Œ Note on Project Progress
- Initially, the frontend and backend were developed in separate repositories to organize and manage development independently. As the project matured, both were integrated into this repository for easier maintenance and deployment.

- Frontend Repository: [DevSwipe Frontend](https://github.com/itsaimsd/DevSwipe-Frontend)
- Backend Repository: [DevSwipe Backend](https://github.com/itsaimsd/DevSwipe-backend)
- These separate repositories provide a detailed record of the progress and development journey of the project. Feel free to explore them to understand the incremental improvements made during the development process.
